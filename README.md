# SolarGenomeProject
The Solar Genome Project seeks to grow society’s collective view of “solar” as pattern (the Solar Ecology Framework), extending our mission throughout the many unique places and localized processes where light has affected our supporting biomes and our cultures. The SGP aspires to design intergenerational solutions that will meet our challenges for food, energy, health, and water demands, while embracing diverse solar goods and services in the spaces that enrich our lives, our homes, and our communities. We will pursue and advocate for transformative methods and tools to measure light in society, demonstrating the value of light as a resource for adaptation and mitigation, and in turn advancing society’s story of solar into the future.
